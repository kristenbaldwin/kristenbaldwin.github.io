    <h1><u>Phonebook App</u></h1>
    <p>You will write a command line program to manage a phone book. When you start the phonebook.py program, it will print out a menu and ask the user to enter a choice:</p>
    <p>$ python phonebook.py<br>
    Electronic Phone Book<br>
    =====================<br>
    1. Look up an entry<br>
    2. Set an entry<br>
    3. Delete an entry<br>
    4. List all entries<br>
    5. Quit<br></p>
    <p>What do you want to do (1-5)?
        <ol>
            <li>If they choose to look up an entry, you will ask them for the person's name, and then look up the person's phone number by the given name and print it to the screen.</li>
            <li>If they choose to set an entry, you will prompt them for the person's name and the person's phone number,</li>
            <li>If they choose to delete an entry, you will prompt them for the person's name and delete the given person's entry.</li>
            <li>If they choose to list all entries, you will go through all entries in the dictionary and print each out to the terminal.</li>
            <li>If they choose to quit, end the program.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>You will add the code necessary to save the database into a file. To save the file, you will provide an additional menu item: "Save entries".</p>
    <p>When they choose to save entries, you save the dictionary that you are using to store all of the information into a file using the pickle module.</p>
    <p>Once you have the save entries feature implemented, you will need to restore the saved information at some point. Provide an additional menu item: "Load save entries" - which will load the saved dictionary from the previous saved file.</p>
