    <h1><u>Guess A Number</u></h1>
    <p><b>Step 1:</b> You will implement a guess-the-number game where the player has to try guessing a secret number until he gets it right. For now, you will "hard code" the secret number to 5 (just set it to five like secret_number = 5). You will prompt the player to enter a number again and again, each time comparing his input to the secret number. To to that, you will need to write a while loop. If he guesses correctly, you will print "You win!", otherwise, you will prompt for a number again.</p>
    <p><b>Step 2 - Give High-Low Hint:</b> Improve your game to provide the player with a high-or-low hint.</p>    
    <p><b>Step 3 - Randomly Generated Secret Number:</b> Instead of hard-coding the secret number to 5 now, you will generate the secret number using a random number generator provided by Python, so that even you, the programmer, cannot know the secret number before hand.</p>
    <p><b>Step 4 - Limit Number of Guesses:</b> Limit the number of guesses the player has to 5. If he cannot guess the number within 5 guesses, he losses.</p>    
    <p><b>Bonus - Play Again:</b> At the conclusion of a game, give the player the option of playing again.</p>
